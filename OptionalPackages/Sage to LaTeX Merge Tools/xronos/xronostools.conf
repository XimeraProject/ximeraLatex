#
#  This is the configuration file for the xronostools set of programs
#  it is used by xronosraw, xronosbatch, xronosfmt, and xronosfinal.
#


# in addition to the control provided by key/value pairs in this file
# some internal variables exist and can be used to substitute for text 
# in your files during processing.  The variables ARE case sensitive so 
# please be careful of the case.  ALL instances are replaced so please do 
# not use these strings in your files by accident or as part of a problem.
#
# The value: XTL_SV_QUESTIONCOUNT is replaced by the question count of the file
# The value: XTL_SV_HELPFILE is replaced by the unquoted name of the helpfile
# The value: XTL_SV_OUTPUTFILE is replaced by the unquoted name of the tex output file
# 
# so \addtocounter{Total@Question}{XTL_SV_QUESTIONCOUNT} 
# becomes: \addtocounter{Total@Question}{200} if there are 200 questions in the file
#
# NOTE: typically the helpfile name input statement is replaced during xronosraw 
# processing in order for pdflatex and sage to run.  The input statement is likely 
# not going to get the internal variable fixup as it will have already been replaced.
# However, if you need the help file name for other reasons just not the typical form
# (e.g., not \input{ ... XTL_SV_HELPFILE ... }) it is available.  
# see HelpFilePlaceHolder is this file for additional xronosraw helpfile processing info.

#  User Defined Substitutions
#
# 	These substitutions occur toward the end of processing.  PDFLatex and sage run before this.
#	The duplicate questions and braces have been removed.  Basically the file is finalized 
#	before this substitution happens, think last thing that occurs.  The substitution is basic 
#	global search and replace.  It does NOT span lines.  If you need to substitute involving a 
#	quoted string.  You can use "the other quotes" to quote the quoted string.
#
#	These are structured in pairs, a search entry and a replace entry.  Both must exist or the 
#	entry is ignored.  The entries go from 01 to 99, single digit numbers must have a leading 0.
#
#XF_USERSUB01_SEARCH = The Old String
#XF_USERSUB01_REPLACE = The New String
#XF_USERSUB02_SEARCH = "The Old String2"
