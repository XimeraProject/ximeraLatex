    %%%     HOW TO USE THIS COMMAND::
    %%%
    %   \newstep[ problemEnvName ]{ Question Code }{ Answer Code }
    %
    %   "problemEnvName" is optional, defaulting to "problem" and is the name 
    %           displayed as the "Problem" environment.
    %   "Question Code" This is the code for the question.
    %   "Answer Code" This is the code for the answer and should contain some 
    %           version of \answer{} or \multipleChoice type command.
    
    \stepcounter{assessmentDepth}%  Keep track of how many nested assessments you have.
    
    %   Now we need to save the "Problem Environment" name that was chosen (default of "Problem").
    %   We need to keep this for the \end command later.   
    \expandafter\edef\csname assessname\roman{assessmentDepth}\endcsname{#1}%

    %   Begin another instance of an environment, 
    %   But only if it's not the initial statement of the problem.
    %   The name is given as an optional argument (defaults to the "Problem"):
    \ifFirstStep\else%   Only include a "\begin" command if you are a substep.
    \begin{#1}%
    \fi% 
    #2%     Display the Question Code
    #3%     Display the Answer Code after the question; so it is displayed above followup answers.
    \stepcounter{trackAns}%     Keep track of how many answers we have written.
    \FirstStepfalse%            First step has been completed, so turn it false.
