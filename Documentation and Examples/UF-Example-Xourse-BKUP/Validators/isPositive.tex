\begin{problem}
    This shows a basic ``isPositive'' validator, that simply checks to see if the input in positive.\\
    Notice that the validator completely overrides the expected answer, as the correctness of the answer is determined by the validator returning true/false, and this validator doesn't actually use the provided answer in any way.
    
    
    Enter a number! $\answer[validator=isPositive]{22}$
    
\end{problem}
