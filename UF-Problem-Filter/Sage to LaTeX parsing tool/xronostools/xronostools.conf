#
#  This is the configuration file for the xronostools set of programs
#  it is used by xronosraw, xronosbatch, and xronosfmt.
#


# in addition to the control provided by key/value pairs in this file
# some internal variables exist and can be used to substitute for text 
# in your files during processing.  The variables ARE case sensitive so 
# please be careful of the case.  ALL instances are replaced so please do 
# not use these strings in your files by accident or as part of a problem.
#
# The value: XTL_SV_QUESTIONCOUNT is replaced by the question count of the file
# The value: XTL_SV_HELPFILE is replaced by the unquoted name of the helpfile
# The value: XTL_SV_OUTPUTFILE is replaced by the unquoted name of the tex output file
# 
# so \addtocounter{Total@Question}{XTL_SV_QUESTIONCOUNT} 
# becomes: \addtocounter{Total@Question}{200} if there are 200 questions in the file
#
# NOTE: typically the helpfile name input statement is replaced during xronosraw 
# processing in order for pdflatex and sage to run.  The input statement is likely 
# not going to get the internal variable fixup as it will have already been replaced.
# However, if you need the help file name for other reasons just not the typical form
# (e.g., not \input{ ... XTL_SV_HELPFILE ... }) it is available.  
# see HelpFilePlaceHolder is this file for additional xronosraw helpfile processing info.

############ Folder Settings

# This stores the folder that holds all the temporary files. The contents of this folder may be safely deleted after a successful program run. It also contains log file data in case there are problems.
#  The output directory for the xronosraw process.
#  Used by xronosraw - defaults to "./XronosOutput/" 
XronosrawOutputDir = "./XronosOutput/"


# This is the location that the problem banks will be built. Unless you are completely redesigning the Problem Bank file structure, this should *NOT* be modified.
# XFinal_OutputDir sets the output directory for the xronosfinal process
#   Used by xronosfinal - defaults to "./" 
XFinal_OutputDir = "/home/jason/texmf/tex/Questions/"



############ Run variables

# RepeatCount sets the number of times the question code is duplicated before the initial run. Note that this isd *BEFORE* the file is pruned for duplicates and content. This number should ideally be about twice the number of desired questions to ensure you get enough non duplicate questions.
# the repeatcount sets the maximum replication of questions
#   Used by xronosraw - min 50 max 5000 defaults to 700 
RepeatCount = 1200


# This is the maximum number of questions that will be listed in the resulting Problem File.
# the XF_MaxQuestions sets the maximum number of questions output
#   Used by xronosfmt - min 1 max 5000 defaults to 500 
# attempting to set this out of range will keep the previous value
XF_MaxQuestions = 500


# XF_TagsRequired requires tags in the input file (a \tagged{ } line)
#   Used by xronosfmt - defaults to yes
XF_TagsRequired = yes


# XF_QuestionsOnly strips the document header and trailer from the file
#   Used by xronosfmt - defaults to yes
XF_QuestionsOnly = yes


# Placeholder used to substitute the help file name into an \input statement
# if the placeholder appears, the entire line is replaced
# the placeholder value is case sensitive
#   Used by xronosraw - defaults to XTL_SV_HELPFILE
# HelpFilePlaceHolder = HELPFILE



########## Cleanup and Logging variables

# IndividualLogFiles breaks the xronosbatch.log file into a log file for each file processed
#   Used by xronosbatch - defaults to no
IndividualLogFiles = no

# CleanupPDFWorkFiles deletes the aux, jax, ids, log, oc, out, and synctex.gz files
#   Used by xronosbatch - defaults to yes
CleanupPDFWorkFiles = yes

# CleanupSageWorkFiles deletes the sagetex.sage, sagetex.sage.py, and sagetex.scmd files
#   Used by xronosbatch - defaults to yes
CleanupSageWorkFiles = yes

# CleanupPDFAndSageFiles deletes the sagetex.sout and .pdf files
#   Used by xronosbatch - defaults to no
CleanupPDFAndSageFiles = no

######
# These are currently unused files.

## These files are loaded before the Archfile is stripped and separated. As such they are likely of little use other than setting content up for the processing system itself.

# XR_InputFileHeader names the file holding the FileHeader lines for the xronosraw process
# the contents of this file are ADDED to the top of the file input to xronosraw
# the content of this file WILL get processed by ALL xronostools
#   Used by xronosraw - defaults to no file
# XR_InputFileHeader = "/usr/local/etc/xronostools/xr_InputHeader.txt"

# XR_InputFileFooter names the file holding the FileFooter lines for the xronosraw process
# the contents of this file are ADDED to the end of the file input by xronosraw
# the content of this file WILL get processed by ALL xronostools
#   Used by xronosraw - defaults to no file
# XR_InputFileFooter = "/usr/local/etc/xronostools/xr_InputFooter.txt"





#####
# These files are optional but not currently in use.

## This is printed at the very top of every question file, before even the "Tags" section. For most cases where we want something at the top of the Problem File, it is better to use xf_OutputHeader.txt
# XFinal_OutputFileHeader names the file holding the FileHeader lines for the xronosfinal process
# the contents of this file are written to the top of the file output from xronosfinal
# xronosfinal is the last stage, no data from this file will be processed by ANY 
# xronostools, including xronosfinal.  This includes any substitution of internal variables.
# It is simply added at the start of the write to the output file.
#   Used by xronosfinal - defaults to no file
#
# XFinal_OutputFileHeader = "/usr/local/etc/xronostools/xfinal_OutputHeader.txt"



## This is printed immediately after the TAGS section of the Problem File. Given that it is processed, it would be easier to use xf_OutputHeader instead, as it would still allow for variable substitution.
# XFinal_InputFileHeader names the file holding the FileHeader lines for the xronosfinal process
# the contents of this file are ADDED to the top of the file input to xronosfinal
# xronosfinal is the last stage, data from this file will be processed only by xronosfinal. 
# It is simply added at the start of the input file.
#   Used by xronosfinal - defaults to no file
#
# XFinal_InputFileHeader = "/usr/local/etc/xronostools/xfinal_InputHeader.txt"


## This is printed at the bottom of the page file, but it is processed first. It is probably better to use xfinal_OutputFooter for this instead.
# XF_InputFileFooter names the file holding the FileFooter lines for the xronosfmt process
# the contents of this file are ADDED at the end of the file input to xronosfmt
# xronosfmt is the last stage, data from this file will be processed only by xronosfmt. 
# It is simply added at the end of the input file.
#   Used by xronosfmt - defaults to no file
# This is (eventually) displayed at the end of the question file, above xfinal_OutputFooter.txt. It would be better to edit the xfinal file for any content that should go directly to the problem file.
#
# XF_InputFileFooter = "/usr/local/etc/xronostools/xf_InputFooter.txt"
